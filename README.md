## Keyboard Shortcuts ‚å®Ô∏è
Recently I came across an idea from JoeReynolds' repo 'What to Code', an idea to create a website with keyboard shortcuts from  different applications and softwares. I thought I'd make it into a reality and tweak it a bit with some useful functionalities.

## Start Up üöÄ
1. Open the project folder in terminal
```
cd keyboard-shortcuts
```
2. Install the dependencies
```
npm i
```
3. Start up the project
```
npm run dev
```
